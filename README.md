- 👋 Hi, I’m @KirillPisarevv
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, physics and mathematics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in ninth grade. Now, as part of not only a school project, I am making my own small satellite of the earth CubeSat based on the Arduino platform.
   I think this is really cool
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on cool projects and do something of my own
